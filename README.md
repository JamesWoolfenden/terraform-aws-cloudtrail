This is an updated example for using Cloudtrail that works, in addition to the trail Glue is added to support querying in Athena.

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Introduction

This module deploys a basic *Cloudtrail* set-up, with kms key and *S3* log bucket and sets up a table for Athena with AWS Glue.

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "cloudtrail" {
  source            = "JamesWoolfenden/cloudtrail/aws"
  version           = "v0.1.3"
  trail             = var.trail
  common_tags       = var.common_tags
}
```

## Checks

This module has a Checkov skip added as the MFA_delete functionality is currently broken in Terraform 0.12.8. I have added an ignore so that you can manually update this item without interference.
